# Expo and Clerk

> [!WARNING]
> Currently the `@clerk/expo` SDK only supports mobile app output. Expo web us not supported. You can upvote the addition of Clerk supporting web output [here](https://feedback.clerk.com/roadmap/fb56a8db-763a-4e0d-a4b2-f8a453be195c).

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Expo application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Expo SDK.

See [the quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/expo) to get started.

## Custom authentication examples

The following guides demonstrate how to build Clerk authentication flows in an Expo app:

- [Multi-factor authentication](/docs/references/expo/expo-mfa)
- [OAuth](/docs/references/expo/expo-oauth)
- [User impersonation](/docs/references/expo/expo-impersonation)

## Deploy Expo apps to production

There are a few caveats to deploying production Expo applications with Clerk. This section will guide you through addressing them.

1. Acquire and add a production web domain to your Clerk application – A valid web domain is required to deploy a production Clerk application, even if your project is a mobile app.
1. Add authorized redirect URLs – To redirect users after they successfully authenticate, you must add the redirect URLs you'll be using to your Clerk application in the Clerk Dashboard with the following steps:
    1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections).
    2. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > Social Connections**.
    3. Scroll to the **Allowlist for mobile OAuth redirect** section and add your redirect URLs.
    > [!TIP]
    > You can also add redirect URLs via [the Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Redirect-URLs#operation/CreateRedirectURL).
1. Follow [the Clerk deployment guide](/docs/deployments/overview).
